# star-painter

 A cute application that lets you paint pretty pictures. The only brush type
 is a star, because it's very practical that way. You can draw stars by
 dragging the mouse across the canvas or entering information and clicking
 "place!" You can click the palette swatches or size buttons on the sides to
 change the brush size and color. You can also press 1-6 on the keyboard to
 pick a color and + or - to increase/decrease the brush size. The clear button
 will clear the canvas without further warning, so tread carefully around it.
